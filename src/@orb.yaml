  Wallarm's Framework for Automated Security Testing (FAST) is a purpose-built tool that allows you to reveal vulnerabilities in web applications by generating and executing security tests automatically. 

  This orb allows to run FAST with CI_MODE=testing when security tests are based on an existing test record.
  To start using this orb you have to setup WALLARM_API_TOKEN at your project's Enviroment Variables page.
  You can find or create Wallarm API token (FAST node token) here: https://my.wallarm.com/nodes. 

  Read more about FAST at https://docs.fast.wallarm.com/en/.
